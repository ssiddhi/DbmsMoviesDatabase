S486/586 Intorduction to Databases
Spring 2022
Final project

Team: Quest Pirates
Members: Manisha Yadav, Leior Varon, Shreshtha Siddhi, Nikhil Sai, Sayed Sarwary


In order to run you first need to export (or source) the following environment variables:
export CLASS_DB_HOST
export CLASS_DB_USERNAME
export CLASS_DB_PASSWORD

Run ./movies.py to source data from movies.csv.
    This will also organize the data, clean  up the database, create the tables, and fill the dat into the tables

After completing the setup the script will allow you to query the database. Enter your query or 'exit' to finish
(only queries for selecting data are suppoerted, not for modifying tables etc.)

****Note: this script will drop tables and views created by previous execution of the script****
If tables with the names used in this project were created externally you may need to manually drop them
before running this script as the script may not have the neccessary permissions to do so itself.


In order to dump contents of the tables and the 20 questions required for the project open the database interpreter
and source project_dump.sql

Thanks!
